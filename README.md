# ðŸŽ¬ clipper
A simple screen gif recording program.   
Press 'Start' to start recording. Clipper holds the most recent x-amount of seconds of screen data and converts it to a gif when you click 'Stop'

Record a clip of your screen immediately to a gif   
- Set the buffer/clip length so that Clipper knows how long ago to clip when you press 'Stop'
- Set the file/path to save the gif to (in relation to the .exe)
- Set the FPS you wish to record at (higher fps = higher processing time)
- Set the quality of the gif (higher quality = higher processing time)
- Press 'Start'!
